      A tooltip in HTML is a small pop-up box or text that appears when a user
      hovers over an element such as a button, link, or image. Tooltips are
      often used to provide additional information about the element or give the
      user context. We can create a tooltip using several methods, including the
      title attribute, CSS hover effects, and CSS pseudo-elements.
